mostly compatible:
Liara Consistency Mod (LE3 ver): works, but skintone on custom outfits is almost white. could be fixed by mod author. 
Iconic Fashion Party: all works as intended, but Tali option will affect the options in the menu as well

known incompatible:
Liara's Asari Breather: works some of the time, but not at others, depending on what is in memory; would be better to convert to be an option in AMM
Visor for Turian Medium Helmet: Missing head under the visor; would be better as an option in AMM, and is already going to be included in LE1DP

TBD
